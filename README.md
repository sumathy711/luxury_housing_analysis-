 Project Overview:
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of developer performance and revenue distribution. The report answers 10 key business questions to help stakeholders understand which developers are driving value and where the project stands financially.

 Key Insights:
Total Revenue: The project has generated a total revenue of [Insert Your Total Revenue Number] Cr, as calculated from the Ticket_Price_Cr field.
Developer Impact: While most developers contribute to the core tasks, specific developers (like L and T) focus on non-revenue generating segments, which is why their revenue charts may show zero while other performance metrics remain high.
Cross-Functional Filters: The report uses Slicers to allow users to toggle between different Developers and observe real-time changes across all 10 question charts.
Revenue Benchmark: The Total Revenue visual is set as a static benchmark, ensuring the "Big Picture" is always visible regardless of individual developer filters.

Mobile Optimization:
The report includes a Mobile-Enhanced View for stakeholders to check key KPIs and the top 3 critical charts on the go, ensuring data accessibility anywhere.
